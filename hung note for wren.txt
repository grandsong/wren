HungNot for wren sample code:

if a base type is two characters, make sure the second character is not already used
as a base type. For example ar and tr are array types, and there is no 'r' type.

This is heavily influenced by the fact that we are coding a web app, so the things we are interested
in are element names, attributes (a special kind of list of name-value pairs), parameter (another
special kind of name-value pair used in queries), classes, and so forth

base types:
	f = flag, boolean
	s = string
	n = number
	ar = array
	tr = tree (an array of arrays)
	q = queue or stack
	mXY = map of X to Y
	mX = map of X to X
	msn = map of string to number, like a counted set
	k = constant or key, also keys in REQUEST
	l = URL info, array of items needed to construct a URL (host, path, query, etc.)
	c = class (as in, the class of an HTML element)
	e = element name, such as A, P, DIV, etc.
	b = an XML attribute, or a name-value pair, which is equivalent to an ms of length 1
		but it isn't just a generic ms, in this case it is an a name-value pair
		used for constructing HTML elements or URL queries, the value gets surrounded with quotes
	arb = array of attributes, same as ms
	p = parameter, a name-value pair used in URL queries (not surrounded with quotes)
	na = name, va = value; these are the name- and value- components in a b or p
