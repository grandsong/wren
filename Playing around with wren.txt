// So here's an idea: Use colon when mapping a pair and both are strings or expressions that evaluate
// to strings. Use the = when the left hand side represents a variable or parameter name:
//      ( 'a' : 'find' )  ==>  ( 'a' : 'find' )
//      key = 'name'
//      ( key : 'fred' )  ==>  ( 'name' : 'fred' ) // `key` is evaluated
//      ( name='fred' )   ==>  ( 'name' : 'fred' ) // `name` is not evaluated, it's turned into a string
//      ( ~key )          ==>  ( 'key' : 'name' )  // `key` is turned into a string for the key, then evaluated for the value
//
// Conceptually, then, an assignment like `s = 'hello'` means the pair 's':'hello' is being added to the local scope dictionary.
// a bare statement like this: 's':'hello' would also work, with the same result. Using a colon means "add to whatever dictionary
// is under construction at the moment, evaluating both sides. Using equal sign means "add to whatever dictionary is under
// construction at the moment, but only evaluate the right-hand side and take the left hand side as the key name (as a literal string.)
// a tilde means ~XXX => XXX = XXX, so the left side is a literal, and the right side is evaluated.

//THOUGHTS:
//  flow control statements don't introduce new scope, so variables set in the 'then' or 'else' clause are available later

//IDEA: in places where we are declaring (typically, constructing an array that represents and object, or one that represents parameters)
//  we don't want to have to put quotes around all our keys, but not doing so would interpet as a variable name.
//  so how about if we start the name with an illegal character, like '.', to indicate "this is a key, put quotes around it".
//  it is conceptually similar to the idea that obj.fred translates into obj['fred'] where fred isn't treated as a variable,
//  but a name that needs to have quotes around it.

// It would be nice to be able to call addElement('p', .sClass: 'warn')
// and not have the second parameter 'class' be assigned to $1.
// And also not require class to come after all the other positional parameters which you would have to set to default values.
// Maybe we only assign to $0, $1, etc. if it is not a keyed item.
// Does this get into what the index and keys of an ordered hash are?
//  a = ( 'p', 10, 'name' : 'mike', 14, true)
// what is a[2]? is it 'mike' or is it 14? would you ever want to access 'mike' other than with the key?

//THOUGHTS about inheritance.
// How do we create a new instance? It isn't just a copy or a reference back to the same variable
// It's a new creature that is more like a version, it has it's own fields that can replace the parent, but the parent can
// still be retrieved with something like a:0:.fIndent. (Is the parent a copy? or is it a reference to the original?) Can any
// subclass change the parent? Maybe if the parent is assigned a key (like 'base') then others can reference and change it if they refer
// to the same version key. objects created without a key are anonymous and others can't change them.
// a = wHTMLComposer->new
// that seems like a lot of chrome just to get another instance.
// we want a not to be a copy, and not to point to the original,
// we want it to be a new version that can replace fields, but still get back to the original
//  if needed with, for example: a:-1:.fIndent

This statement

	cp->addElement('div')

means addElement function will be called with $obj equal to cp and $arg equal to ('div')
and also $0 will equal 'div', so $0 is the same as $arg[0]
we'll first look at the cp object for a member under `addElement` and use that, otherwise we'll
look in the current scope and up for `addElement`

Inside a function call we can explicitly use $obj to access the calling object (or it may be nil)
Inside the function, bare names will be checked against $arg and then $obj. Changes to a member of
$arg won't affect anything outside the function, but changes to $obj will affect that object.
